     <h3> Html Elements</h3>
    Html generally stand for Hyper Text Markup Language. Html describes the structure of web pages 
    using markup. Html was invented by Tim Berners-Lee a <br>British computer scientist. Originally, Html 
    was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists,
     and so forth <br> to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers. Now, Html is being
      widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags <br>available in Html languages. 
</p> The Html Elements are the basic building blocks of a web page. they define the structure and 
     content of a web page by using tags to enclose different types of content, <br> like text, images, links.
     Html elements provide the foundation for creating web pages but don't inherently convey specific 
     meaning or context to the content they contain. <br>
      It usually consist of a start tag and end tag, with the content inserted
     in between. The Html elements is everything from the start tag to the end tag.
      Examples of Html <br> elements includes; '/div>', '/span>','/p>','/h1>', ecetera. 
      Additionally, Html elements can be nested (elements can contain elements). 
     All Html documents consist of nested <br>Html elements. for instances; all the elements from the 
     DOCTYPES, /body, and /html are all Html elements. Furthermore, Html elements with no content 
     are called empty <br> elements. for example, /br>, is an empty element without a closing tag. the /br>
     defines a line break.
     <h3> Semantic Html Elements</h3>
     Semantic Html Elements are special tags in Html that that provide meaning and context to the content 
     they contain. They help describe the structure of web documents in <br> a way that is easily understandable
     for both human beings and machines. Essentially, semantic Html elements makes your code more organized, 
     readable, and meaningful. 
     <h3>Differences Between Html Elements And Semantic Html Elements</h3>
     The differences between the Html elements and the semantic Html elements includes
     some of the following:
     <ol type="1">
        <li>Html elements are the basic building blocks of a web page. They provide no inherent 
            meaning or context to the content. Semantic Html file on the otherhand, <br> provide meaning 
            and context to the content they enclose.
        </li>
        <li>Html elements define the structure and content of a web page. While Semantic Html elements
            better structure and organize the content.
        </li>
        <li> Html elements is often used for styling and scripting purposes while semantic Html convey
            meaning and intent to assistive tech.
        </li>
        <li>Semantic html elements can improve SEO (Search Engine Optimization)as search engines understand 
            the meaning  and context of the content better. Html elements <br> have limited impact on SEO</li>
           <li>Examples of Html elements are; div, span, p, h1-h6 ecetera. Example of the semantic html 
            elements include; header, footer, nav, article, section, main, fiqure, aside, ecetera. 
           </li> 
     </ol>
     <p>In conclusion, while Html elements provide the basic structure of a web page, semantic Html 
        enhance the meaning and context of the content, leading to better readability, <br> accessibility, SEO 
        and styling.
     </p>
     <h2>Closing Tags and Self-Closing Tags in Html</h2>
     Closing tags in Html are used to explicitly mark the end of an Html elements. They are written by enclosing
     the content of the element betweeen an opening tag and a corresponding <br> closing tag. This helps define the 
     boundaries of the element's content within the Html document, making the structure clear and organized. 
     For example, in <'p> paragraphs contain here. <br> <'/p> - which is the closing tag indicates the end of the 
     paagraph element, ensuring proper rendering and interpretation by web browsers. 
    </p> Self-Closing tags in Html are used to define elements that do not contain any content and do not 
    require a seperate closing tag. They are written with a forward slash before the closing <br> angle bracket, 
    immediately following the opening tag. Self-closing tags represent standalone elements and are typically used 
    for elements like, images, line breaks, and input fields.<br> For example, <'img sar='image.jpg'/> is a 
    self-closing tag that define an image element without any content, while <'br> represent a line breal element. 
    <h3>Differences Between Closing Tags and Self-Closing Tags in Html</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Closing tags are used to explicitly mark the end of an Html element by closing the 
            content within the opening and closing tags like, the <'div> content <'/div>.On the other hand, <br> 
            self-closing tags are used to define elements that do not have any content nested within them and 
            don't require a seperate closing tag. they end with a forward slash before the close <br> angle bracket, like
            <'img src=image.jpg"/>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Closing tags can enclose other Html elements or plain text content within them. While self-closing 
            tags do not enclose any content. They are standalone and represent single <br>elements without content.
        </li>
        <li>
            Closing tags provide clarity about where an elements and ends, making the structure of the document 
            clearer. Self-closing tags simplify markup, especially for elements <br> without content, making it more 
            concise. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Closing tags is compatible with all Html versions and widely supported by browsers. Self-closing 
            tags is introduced in Html as Xhtml syntax but adopted in Html5. Supported  <br>in modern browsers and 
            Html5-compatible documents.
        </li>
        <li>
            Examples of closing tags are; <br> <'div> content <'/div> <br> 
            <'p> paragraph <'/p> <br> <'span> text <'/span> ecetera. <br>
            EXamples of self-closing tags include the following; <br>
            <'img src=image.jpg"/> <br> <'br /> <br> 
            <'input type="text"/>, ecetera.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p> In summary, closing tags are used to mark the beginning and end of elements with content, 
        while self-closing tags represent standalone elements without content, providing a <br>
        concise and clear way to define certain types of elements in Html.

    <h3>Inline Elements and Block Elements </h3>
    
Inline elements in Html are elements that don't start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. 
They typically flow within a line of text or other inline elements. <br>Put differently, Inline elements can 
appear within sentences and do not have to apear on a new line of their own. The <'br>, <'i>, <'u>, <'em>,
<'strong>, <'sup>, <'big>, <'small>, <br> <'li>, <'ins>, <'del>, <'code>, <'cite>, <'dfn>, <'kbd> and <'var> 
elements are all inline elements.
<p>
Block elements in Html are elements that start on a new line and take up the full width available. 
They create a "block" of content, pushing other elements to start on a new line <br>before and after them.
They all start on their own new line, and anything that follows them appears on its own new line.
For example, <'p>, <'h1> - <'h6>, <'ul>, <'ol>, <'dl>, <'pre>, <br> <'hr>, />, <'blockquote> and <'address>
elements are all block level elements.
<h3>Differences Between Inline Elements and Block Elements </h3>
<ol>
    <li>The inline elements flow alongside surrounding content
        while Block elements start on a new line.
    </li>
    <li>
        While the inline elements occupies only necessary width, the block elements on the 
        other hand, occupies full available width.
    </li>
    <li>
        The inline elements can not have a specified width and height while the block elements
        can have width and height specified.
    </li>
    <li>In inline elements, the margine and paddlings are applied horizontally, affecting 
    surrounding contents while in block elements, the margins and paddlings can be around.    
    </li>
